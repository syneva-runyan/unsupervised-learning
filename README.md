# Unsupervised Learning
python version 3.7.3

The code for this assignment can be found in the public repository [here](https://github.com/syneva-runyan/unsupervised-learning.git)

The main.py file can be ran to execute the assignments algorithms on both data sets.

In order to run the algorithms, you must first install each of the modules imported at the top of the file using pip

```
pip install sklearn
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
```

From there, you can run the algorithms with:

`python main.py`

Print statements will inform you on the way what algorithm and what data set is being targeted.
